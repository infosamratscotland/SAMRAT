        <h2 class="text-center hdr">The information we collect and how we use it</h2>
          <p>The legal basis for processing your personal data is that we have a legitimate interest in doing so. The legitimate interest being pursued is that as a community organisation we need to hold a certain amount of personal data relating to our members or visitors to communicate with them and manage their membership.</p>
          <p>In using and attending our events or services you consent to the collection and use of your Personal Data as set out in this Privacy Notice.
          <p>We collect information about you directly from you and your family. This is primarily done via application forms (for example membership application forms and event booking forms) and emails.</p>
          <p>On some occasions, we may add information about you when received from another visitor/ member of the Mandal, a family member, or a third party where it is relevant, and we have confidence it is accurate. This typically happens when someone else is registering another guest for an event or using a third-party website and you have given your consent to them. We may combine information that we already have about you with information available publicly from external sources to gain a better understanding of you. This may include social media sites.</p>
          <p>If you provide information for another person, you need to first ensure they agree for you to do so and be clear about what information you will provide. You must inform them of where they can find our Privacy Notice.</p>
